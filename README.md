# Style Transfer using VGG19

Built a Style Transfer CNN model that applies a style of an image onto the content of another image resulting in a style transfer. My approach is based off a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch using pre-trained VGG19.

> Style transfer relies on separating the content and style of an image. Given one content image and one style image, we aim to create a new, target image which should contain our desired content and style components:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) objects and their arrangement are similar to that of the content image
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) style, colors, and textures are similar to that of the style image
